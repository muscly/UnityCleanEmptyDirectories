UnityCleanEmptyDirectories
==========================

This is an asset that cleans empty directories and corresponding meta files in your project.
I created this asset to solve [empty directories on Unity and Git problem](http://altprog.com/en/2014/10/28/empty-folders-meta-files-unity-3d-and-git/).
You can also install this asset from the [Asset Store](http://u3d.as/content/alt-prog/clean-empty-directories).
